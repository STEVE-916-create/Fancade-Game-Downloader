# Fancade-Game-Downloader
Ever wanted to download the original Drive Mad to *edit all* the levels?
Saw a cool project of someone and wanted to get the *full editable source*?
You want to own a bunch of games?
You wanna be THE hackerman?
Or you're here to study my code?
Well,...

This is a Python 3 tool (someone ran this on Python 2 but failed) that downloads Fancade Game files by the game link.

(website version coming soon)

**Use at your own risk, this breaks the Fancade Terms Of Use.**

### Dependencies
This tool needs the `requests` PIP package. To install, run `pip install requests`.

### Running the program
To use the program, `downloader.py`.

There is a `input()` in the Python file to prompt you for the Fancade game link. Plus it makes it so that YOU can edit it!

For the mobilers: Remember to zip the downloaded file to actually import it to Fancade. Also sadly this won't work for iOS, the web version will fix that.
